# Crystal Mage Academy

## Chapter 1: The Invitation

Mizuki stared at the shimmering envelope in her hands, hardly daring to believe it was real. The wax seal—a crystal surrounded by five elemental symbols—confirmed what she had thought impossible: she had been accepted to Crystal Mage Academy, the most prestigious magical institution in the world.

"You've been quiet for five minutes now," her grandmother said, setting down a cup of tea. "Are you going to open it, or shall I?"

Mizuki's hands trembled as she broke the seal. The letter inside wasn't written on paper but on a thin sheet of enchanted crystal that glowed with soft blue light.

*"Dear Mizuki Tanaka,*

*It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been accepted to Crystal Mage Academy. Your evaluation revealed extraordinary potential in crystal manipulation, a rare gift that has not been seen at the Academy for over a century.*

*Term begins on the first day of the Autumn Equinox. A portal will open at your residence at sunrise. Please bring only essential personal items. All magical equipment will be provided.*

*We look forward to helping you develop your unique abilities.*

*Headmistress Himiko Sato"*

"I don't understand," Mizuki whispered. "I've never even used magic before. There must be a mistake."

Her grandmother smiled mysteriously. "No mistake, child. The crystals choose their mages, not the other way around. Your mother was the same."

Mizuki looked up sharply. "My mother? You told me she was an artist who died in an accident."

"She was an artist—a crystal artist, the finest the Academy had ever seen. And it was no accident that took her from us." Her grandmother's eyes grew distant. "She sacrificed herself to seal something away, something that should never be freed."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"Because knowledge is power, Mizuki, and power attracts attention. I wanted you to have a normal childhood." Her grandmother took her hands. "But the crystals have awakened in you now, and you must learn to control them. The Academy is the only place where you'll be safe."

Mizuki felt dizzy with questions. "Safe from what?"

Before her grandmother could answer, a sharp crack split the air. The crystal letter in Mizuki's hands flared brilliantly, and a small shard broke off, hovering between them. It spun rapidly, projecting an image of a severe-looking woman with silver hair pulled into a tight bun.

"Mizuki Tanaka," the projection spoke, "this is Headmistress Sato. I apologize for this unusual communication, but circumstances have changed. The portal will open tomorrow at dawn, not at the equinox. Pack quickly and be ready. Your safety depends on it."

The projection flickered and vanished, leaving the room in sudden darkness.

"Grandmother, what's happening?"

The old woman was already moving, pulling an ancient trunk from beneath her bed. "They've found you sooner than I feared. The seal your mother created is weakening."

"What seal? Who's found me?"

Her grandmother opened the trunk, revealing a collection of crystals and strange artifacts. "Those who believe the darkness your mother imprisoned is actually a source of power they can control." She pressed a small, clear crystal into Mizuki's palm. "This was hers. Keep it with you always."

The crystal felt warm against Mizuki's skin, and for a brief moment, she thought she heard her mother's voice whispering from within it: *Be brave, my little crystal mage.*

Mizuki closed her fingers around the crystal, feeling something awaken inside her—something that had been sleeping her entire life. "I'll need to pack," she said with newfound determination.

Tomorrow, she would step through a portal into a world of magic, danger, and secrets. Tomorrow, she would begin to discover who she truly was.
