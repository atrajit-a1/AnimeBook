# Cherry Blossom Promises

## Chapter 1: Reunion

Haruki checked his watch for the fifth time in as many minutes. The train was late, and the cherry blossoms wouldn't wait. Peak bloom was predicted for today, and he had promised to photograph them for his magazine assignment.

When the train finally arrived at Kyoto Station, he rushed toward the exit, camera bag bouncing against his hip. That's when he collided with someone—a young woman in a pale pink coat, her arms full of shopping bags that now scattered across the station floor.

"I'm so sorry!" Haruki knelt to help gather her belongings. "I wasn't looking where I was—"

He froze as their eyes met. Those eyes—soft brown with flecks of gold near the pupils—he would recognize them anywhere.

"Mei?"

She stared back, lips parted in surprise. "Haruki? Is that really you?"

Twelve years melted away in an instant. Suddenly, they were children again, making promises under the cherry trees in her grandmother's garden.

"I can't believe it," he said, helping her to her feet. "What are you doing in Kyoto? I thought your family moved to America."

Mei tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, a gesture so familiar it made his heart ache. "We did. I'm just visiting for... for my grandmother's memorial. And to finalize some wedding arrangements."

"Wedding arrangements?" The words felt like ice in his veins.

She nodded, not quite meeting his eyes. "I'm getting married in June. My fiancé is in Tokyo on business, so I came ahead to sort out some details."

"Congratulations," Haruki managed, the word tasting bitter on his tongue. He should have expected this. Twelve years was a lifetime.

An awkward silence stretched between them until Mei glanced at his camera bag. "Still taking pictures?"

"It's my job now. I work for 'Seasons of Japan' magazine." He hesitated, then added, "Actually, I was heading to Maruyama Park to photograph the cherry blossoms."

Something flickered in her eyes—recognition, nostalgia, perhaps regret. "Our favorite spot."

"You remember."

"Of course I do." She bit her lip. "We promised to meet there again someday, didn't we?"

Haruki nodded, memories washing over him. Two ten-year-olds with pinky fingers linked, vowing to return to the cherry trees when they were grown up. A promise forgotten by time but not by heart.

"I have some time before my next appointment," Mei said suddenly. "Would you mind if I joined you? For old times' sake?"

Haruki knew he should refuse. She belonged to someone else now. But the words that came out were: "I'd like that."

They walked together through the ancient streets of Kyoto, catching up on twelve years of separate lives. Mei had become an architect, specializing in blending traditional Japanese elements with modern design. Her fiancé was the son of her father's business partner, a match that seemed more practical than passionate.

"And you?" she asked as they approached the park. "Did you ever marry?"

Haruki shook his head. "Never found the right person." *Or rather, never found you again*, he thought but didn't say.

Maruyama Park was crowded with tourists and locals alike, all gathered to witness the spectacle of cherry blossoms in full bloom. But Haruki knew a secluded spot, a small hill overlooking a pond where an ancient weeping cherry tree stood in solitary splendor.

"It's still here," Mei whispered as they approached the tree. "Our tree."

The weeping cherry was even more magnificent than in their childhood memories, its cascading branches creating a curtain of pink blossoms that swayed gently in the spring breeze.

Haruki raised his camera, focusing on the delicate petals, but found himself capturing Mei instead—her expression of wonder as she gazed up at the blossoms, cherry petals caught in her hair like a natural crown.

"You know," she said softly, "in all these years, I've never seen cherry blossoms as beautiful as the ones in Kyoto."

"They say cherry blossoms represent the transience of life," Haruki replied. "Beautiful and perfect, but only for a moment."

Mei turned to him, something unspoken in her eyes. "Some moments are worth waiting a lifetime for."

A cherry petal drifted down, landing on her cheek. Without thinking, Haruki reached out to brush it away, his fingers lingering against her skin. Time seemed to stop as they stood beneath the canopy of blossoms, the years between them dissolving like morning mist.

Mei's phone chimed, breaking the spell. She checked it and sighed. "That's my wedding planner. I should go."

"Of course." Haruki stepped back, reality crashing down around him.

Mei hesitated, then reached into her purse and handed him a business card. "I'm in Kyoto for two weeks. Perhaps we could meet again?"

Haruki took the card, knowing he should refuse but unable to let her go so soon after finding her again. "I'd like that."

As she walked away, cherry petals swirling around her like pink snow, Haruki raised his camera one last time. Through the viewfinder, he watched the woman he had never forgotten disappear into the crowd, leaving him with nothing but memories and a business card—and perhaps, if he dared to hope, a second chance at a promise made under cherry blossoms.
