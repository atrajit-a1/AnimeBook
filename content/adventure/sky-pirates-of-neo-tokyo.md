# Sky Pirates of Neo-Tokyo

## Chapter 1: The Floating City

Hana tightened the last bolt on her mechanical glider and wiped the grease from her hands. From her workshop balcony, she could see all of Neo-Tokyo—a sprawling city of brass and steam, suspended in the clouds by massive anti-gravity engines. Below, only toxic mist and ruins remained of the old world.

"Perfect timing," she muttered, checking her pocket watch. The Magistrate's airship parade would begin in exactly thirty minutes, and she needed a better view of their engines. Her father had disappeared while working on those ships, and today marked the one-year anniversary of his vanishing.

The floating city had been her home for all nineteen years of her life, but lately, it felt more like a prison. The Magistrate controlled everything—the engines, the food, the air—and anyone who questioned their authority tended to disappear. Like her father.

Hana strapped herself into the glider and adjusted her goggles. With a deep breath, she leaped from the balcony, her heart racing as she plummeted for a terrifying moment before the wings caught the updraft. She soared between towering pagodas and steam-powered factories, navigating the narrow passages between buildings with practiced precision.

As she approached the main skyway, she spotted the parade. Twelve massive airships, each decorated with the Magistrate's crimson banners, moved in perfect formation. Hana pulled out her spyglass and focused on the lead ship's engine compartment, searching for any clue about her father's work.

Suddenly, an explosion rocked the lead airship. Flames erupted from its port side, and it began to list dangerously. The crowd below screamed in panic as debris rained down on the city streets.

"What in the world?" Hana gasped, banking her glider toward the commotion.

That's when she saw them—a sleek black airship emerging from the clouds, its hull adorned with a skull-and-crossbones flag. Sky pirates. They were firing grappling hooks onto the damaged Magistrate vessel.

Hana should have turned away. Pirates were dangerous criminals, enemies of the Magistrate. But something caught her eye—a symbol painted on the pirate ship's hull. It was her father's personal mark, the same one he stamped on all his inventions.

Without hesitation, Hana adjusted her course, heading straight for the pirate ship. If they had a connection to her father, she needed to know. Even if it meant becoming an enemy of Neo-Tokyo.

As she approached, a young man with wild red hair and a captain's coat spotted her from the deck. He raised an eyebrow, then grinned and offered a mock salute.

"Well, well," he called out as she glided closer. "Looks like we've caught the attention of a little sparrow. Care to join the Crimson Cloud crew, or are you just here for the show?"

Hana narrowed her eyes. "I'm looking for my father, Hiroshi Tanaka. And I think you know where he is."

The captain's smile vanished. "Tanaka's daughter? Get on board—now! We've got Magistrate fighters incoming!"

As if on cue, alarm bells rang throughout the city, and Hana spotted a squadron of combat autogyros rising from the military district. She had just seconds to make her decision: return to her life as a law-abiding citizen or become a pirate and finally learn the truth about her father.

With a deep breath, she banked her glider toward the pirate ship's open cargo bay.

Sometimes, to find answers, you had to be willing to fall.
